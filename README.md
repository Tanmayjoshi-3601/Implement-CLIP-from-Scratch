# CLIP Model Implementation

## Introduction to CLIP

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. It was introduced in the paper "Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision" by Radford et al. (2021).

CLIP is designed to understand and connect images and text in a meaningful way by training on a large dataset of image-text pairs from the internet. This allows the model to learn a wide range of visual concepts directly from raw text, without requiring manually labeled datasets.

### Why CLIP is Important

- **Zero-shot learning capabilities**: CLIP can perform image classification tasks it wasn't explicitly trained on
- **Flexibility across visual tasks**: Works for a variety of vision tasks without task-specific training
- **Multimodal understanding**: Creates a unified embedding space for both images and text
- **Robustness**: Shows better robustness to distribution shifts compared to traditional supervised models
- **Versatility**: Enables text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a CLIP-like model for multimodal learning between images and text.

## Model Architecture

### TextEncoder
Processes text inputs using a DistilBERT model:
- Extracts the [CLS] token representation
- Projects to a fixed embedding dimension
- Applies layer normalization

### ImageEncoder
Processes image inputs using a Vision Transformer:
- Uses a customizable ViT architecture
- Projects to the same embedding dimension as the text encoder
- Applies layer normalization

### CLIPModel
The main model that:
- Combines the text and image encoders
- Computes similarity between text and image embeddings
- Applies contrastive loss to align the embeddings

## Requirements
